#This deck is a combination of an Under-deeps underdog strategy (see page 
#9) and an agent influence strategy (see page 7). Both strategies are slow to 
#get started, but hard to stop once they get going-sort of like a Volvo.
#
#With an underdog strategy you do not want to be too close to your opponent 
#in marshalling points. Worry more about getting the right items under Great 
#Secrets Buried There and about getting non-item marshalling points to 
#balance out your total for the Free Council. Also, be sure to get some 
#weapons for your characters and items you can only get upstairs like 
#Emerald of the Mariner. The Torque of Hues is good, since it can be useful 
#when entering the Under-deeps.
#
#You will need to build up your hand for the final turn. To this end use Pallando 
#and Emerald of the Mariner to increase your hand size. Have some And 
#Forth He Hasteneds and Crams ready for untapping characters during the 
#site phase, and perhaps a Healing Herbs to unwound someone. Also have a 
#Thorough Search ready to get the most out of the Under-deeps site. Great 
#Secrets Buried There makes it hard to disguise your potential, so your 
#opponent may be ready for your movement into the Under-deeps.
#
#The hazard strategy is an agent influence strategy. It uses Golodhros and 
#some smaller mind agents, so it is halfway between a hunt and a blanket 
#strategy. Most of the agents were picked for popular factions in my play 
#group, but your mileage may vary. If other factions are popular in your group, 
#it would be good to switch some of the agents.
